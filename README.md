# Facial Emotion Detection using CNN

## Overview

This project implements a **Facial Emotion Detection** system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**. The model classifies facial expressions into seven emotion categories: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**.

## Dataset

We use the **FER-2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) dataset**, which consists of **32,298 grayscale 48x48 images** of human faces labeled with different emotions.

## Features

- Uses **CNNs** for high accuracy in emotion classification.
- Trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**.
- Supports real-time emotion detection from images.
- Utilizes deep learning frameworks like **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Facial-Emotion-Detection.git
cd Facial-Emotion-Detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the model training:

```bash
python train.py
```

To test the model on an image:

```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The project employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with multiple layers including:

- **Convolutional Layers** for feature extraction
- **Max-Pooling Layers** to reduce dimensionality
- **Fully Connected Layers** for classification

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing facial emotions, making it suitable for applications in **human-computer interaction, mood analysis, and AI-driven sentiment detection**.

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time emotion detection using OpenCV.
- Improve accuracy by using transfer learning techniques.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
